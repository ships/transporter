# Abstract

The first goal of TRANSPORTER is to promote generality and accessibility of
software and information systems. Where we find useful abstractions in these
systems and the tools surrounding them, their potential and usefulness for
humane purposes and worker empowerment are nascent. However, learnings and
extant arts in this area are maturing. In its success mode, HAUBERK contributes
to this maturity in these ways:

1. as a concrete shortcut to usefully employed software systems, controlled by
   and serving to protect an individual or group generally underserved by
   information technology at large.
2. as an example of an accessible software tool, which may drive developing
   clarity around the behaviors and requirements of such a tool.
